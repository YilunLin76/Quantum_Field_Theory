# Quantum_Field_Theory
This is a repository where I display my interests and thoughts in Quantum Field Theory. It includes part of notes during my self-study in QFT and its relative fields (e.g. classical field theory, elementary particle physics, and mathematical foundations).    

I am eager to present, from my own unique perspective, the story of why and how we move from classical field theory to second quantization and renormalization, sharing my academic journey while also offering valuable insights to a broad readership.    

I have carefully studied *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model* by Matthew D. Schwartz, which is also my favorite textbook in Physics so far. It provides a comprehensive description of the field in a modern perspective. I take a keen interest in the community's efforts devoted to unifying gauge interactions and gravitation, such as TQFT, CFT and string theory, while a rigorous foundation in Quantum Field Theory is essential for understanding what challenges the traditional QFT framework has met and what will be a potential direction to overcome these challenges.    

I personally recommend readers to read this QFT repository and another repository displaying my paper *Chern-Simons Theory in Topological Quantum Field Theory* pinned on my GitHub personal profile (homepage) firstly, which are two of the most exciting ones. More deep cogitation always leads to exceptionally robust insight and extremely accurate physical intuition! Click in now to embark on an exhilarating journey exploring the precise framework of traditional QFT and the amazing TQFT which doesn't depend on metrics with me.
